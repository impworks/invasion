# Invasion

A simple game I created as a university project back in 2008.

Aim the turret with your mouse and don't let any bomb hit the ground!
The game gets harder as you play.

The source is for Visual C++ 6.0 and uses the incredible [HGE](https://github.com/kvakvs/hge) library for rendering.
Not sure if it still compiles in modern versions.
